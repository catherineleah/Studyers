## Welcome to Studyers.
Studyers is a web software that helps students take notes & share them with each other.
You can use Studyers to setup your own private network of students or join us and make [studyers.com](http://www.studyers.com) better.

## Code stack
Studyers is built on top of Ruby on Rails.
The Frontend is heavily relied on HTML5, jQuery & vanilla javascript.

## How can you contribute

### What needs to be done?
* Make it better.
* Write unit testings (we use Rspec). In the current version there are no unit testings.
* Find bugs (and fix them!)
* Add functionality.
* Add more languages support.

### How can it be done?

* When you find a bug, add an issue to Studyers core here on github.
* Fork, fix and ask for a pull.
